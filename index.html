They can be fitted to buildings of any shape or size, and cost less to install than they ever have. Solar panels can provide enough power to make a building completely energy-independent and can even take the form of shingle-sized solar shingles which are interwoven with the rest of a building’s shingles.</p>

            <img src="images/img33.jpg" alt="">
          <p class="center">Impermeable paving like concrete and asphalt is a major environmental concern, and is not sustainable at the rate it’s being installed across the globe. This is because impermeable paving is not only sourced from non-environmentally-friendly places, but it requires more resources to produce and poses a flooding and pollution threat to the very ground it’s laid on.

            Concrete and asphalt paving, as well as other types of impermeable paving, require drainage systems to manage their stormwater runoff. These require a lot of resources and time to install.

            <img src="images/img3.webp" alt="">
          <p class="center">
            Permeable paving, however, provides a paved surface with equal to or greater than the functional value of impermeable paving, while allowing liquid to drain directly through it into a detention base that acts like a detention pond or into the ground itself. TRUEGRID pavers can be used to build driveways, commercial parking lots, fire lanes, industrial parking lots, and any other space that requires paving. The process of installing these pavers is much simpler than traditional paving, requiring far fewer resources and time, while putting much less of a strain on the local environment.</p>

          <p class="center">ICF construction has taken the world by storm in recent years, especially areas prone to extreme weather. Fox Blocks is leading the charge in this category with its environmentally friendly methods and materials. Insulated Concrete Forms are hollow concrete blocks reinforced by rebar. 

            They form a solid, continuous barrier against air and vapor, exceeding airtightness requirements in every municipality and region, as well as providing far superior strength and durability in the face of extreme weather like hurricanes, tornadoes, and more. 
            
            How Fox Blocks differs from their competition, though, is that their materials are specifically designed with eco-friendliness in mind. They do not off-gas and they aren’t made with any gases which are harmful to the ozone or our environment. They also require low levels of energy to build, and the process of doing so is incredibly efficien t. 
            
            Fox Blocks are sustainable and will last the entire lifetime of a home or building. Because of their superior energy efficiency, they go a long way towards lowering overall energy usage and waste throughout the lifetime of a home or building as well.</p>

          <p class="center">In 2023, the proliferation of green spaces within urban environments is expected to continue on a large scale. Green spaces are areas of trees, grass, and other types of vegetation located within primarily urban environments. New York City’s Central Park is one of the biggest sustainable development examples.

            In addition to being a welcome aesthetic and a change of pace from the concrete and skyscrapers in urban areas, green spaces also provide real value in terms of sustainability. They help to improve air quality, recharge supplies of groundwater, reduce air temperature, and protect streams and lakes from polluted runoff. They also prevent soil erosion and help maintain the quality of water in the area.</p>

          <p class="center">This is a method of turning waste into energy and yet another one of the best sustainable development examples we’ll see next year. These facilities use combustion to turn non-hazardous waste into steam energy and electricity. Rather than being sent to a landfill, waste such as rags, absorbents, PPE, and organic debris are combusted and used to provide energy, reducing a building or area’s dependence on external energy providers.</p>
